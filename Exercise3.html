<p>
    GeForce is a brand of graphics processing units (GPUs) designed by Nvidia. As of the GeForce 20 Super series, there have been sixteen iterations of the design.
    GeForce products were discrete GPUs designed for add-on graphics boards, 
    intended for the high-margin PC gaming market, 
    and later diversification of the product line covered all tiers of the PC graphics market, ranging from cost-sensitive[1] GPUs integrated on motherboards, 
    to mainstream add-in retail boards.
    Most recently, GeForce technology has been introduced into Nvidia's line of embedded application processors, designed for electronic handhelds and mobile handsets.

        With respect to discrete GPUs, found in add-in graphics-boards, 
        Nvidia's GeForce and AMD's Radeon GPUs are the only remaining competitors in the high-end market. 
        Along with its nearest competitor, the AMD Radeon, the GeForce architecture is moving toward general-purpose graphics processor unit (GPGPU).
        [citation needed] GPGPU is expected to expand GPU functionality beyond the traditional rasterization of 3D graphics, 
        to turn it into a high-performance computing device able to execute arbitrary programming code in the same way a CPU does, 
        but with different strengths (highly parallel execution of straightforward calculations) and weaknesses (worse performance for complex decision-making code).
